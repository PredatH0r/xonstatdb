This is the source for xonstatdb, the Xonotic Statistics database.
All code herein is intended for the PostgreSQL database management server.

To build, first create the user that will own all of the objects in the 
database. You must run this as an administrator user in your cluster.
See your operating system's guidelines for how this is set up on 
your system:
    
    create user xonstat with password 'xonstat';

    *Note: please change this password

Next, create the database itself:

    CREATE DATABASE xonstatdb
      WITH ENCODING='UTF8'
        OWNER=xonstat
        CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;

Create the schema in which all of the xonstat tables will reside:

    CREATE SCHEMA xonstat
       AUTHORIZATION xonstat;

Navigate to the 'build' directory. Log into the database as the 
admin user created above and issue the following to build the
initial tables:

    \i build/build_full.sql

    *Note: You will see a lot of NOTICE messages. This is normal.

TODO:

- Define indexes
- Audit report SQL to verify index usage 
- ? Partition games, player_game_stats, player_weapon_stats via inheritance
