This is the source for xonstatdb, the Xonotic Statistics database.
All code herein is intended for the PostgreSQL database management server.

To build, first create the user that will own all of the objects in the 
database. You must run this as an administrator user in your cluster.
See your operating system's guidelines for how this is set up on 
your system:
    
    create user xonstat with password 'xonstat';

    *Note: please change this password

Next, create the database itself:

    CREATE DATABASE xonstatdb
      WITH ENCODING='UTF8'
        OWNER=xonstat
        CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;

Next, log into the newly created database using the user account
you just created:

    psql -U xonstat xonstatdb

Create the schema in which all of the xonstat tables will reside:

    CREATE SCHEMA xonstat
       AUTHORIZATION xonstat;

Create the pgplsql language:

    CREATE LANGUAGE pgplsql;

Back in the command shell, navigate to the 'build' directory. 
Log into the database as the admin user created above and issue 
the following to build the initial tables:

    \i build/build_full.sql

    *Note: You will see a lot of NOTICE messages. This is normal.
